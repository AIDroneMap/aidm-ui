# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add the 90-argument catalogue, reconcile settings against each engine and validate values before task creation. Evidence: `shared/option-catalogue.test.ts`, the option-route tests in `server/engines/routes.test.ts`, and the pre-creation validation tests in `server/task-api/task-client.test.ts`. The real task API test checks drift in CI with the exact API 2.6.1 compatibility baseline documented in `docs/notes/0061-option-sources.md`. Closes #61.
- Add project list, names, notes and deletion. Project route and sample-job tests cover task cleanup, retry and keeping imported files. Page tests cover project facts and labels.

- Add shared native controls and design tokens, and use them on existing pages. Component, browser keyboard, contrast and page tests are in `web/src/controls/` and `web/src/pages/`.
